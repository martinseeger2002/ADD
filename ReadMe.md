# Anti Doginal Dogs (ADD)
By: [@TheNodeRunners](https://twitter.com/TheNodeRunners)

## Description
A 10,000-piece Recursive collection, trolling these scammers immutably on the blockchain forever!

***Specifically these Scammers***
Doginal Dogs [@doginaldogsx](https://twitter.com/doginaldogsx), Bark [@barkmeta](https://twitter.com/barkmeta), Books [@DaoKwonDo](https://twitter.com/DaoKwonDo), Shibo [@GodsBurnt](https://twitter.com/GodsBurnt), & [@blknoiz06](https://twitter.com/@blknoiz06) have been part of rug pull after rug pull. They dump on their own community and own 70-80% of their own 10k Doginal Dogs collection, allowing them to artificially manipulate the floor price.

These individuals will do and say anything to keep scamming people. They are scumbags. Everyone can see it now, so let everyone know the truth about these jackasses. In their own words, they "came from ETH, SOL. Saw the inscriptions on BTC thought damn those inscribing fees are wild no way is that sustainable. Came here to DOGECOIN. Super cheap, fun, fast, effective." They had no intention to add real value, innovation, or positivity to our ecosystem. They came solely to extract liquidity from our unsuspecting, loving community.

**We Will Protector Our Community.** 

Everyone's a crypto or meme coin expert until scammers like this take your bag. Not in our Monopoly game. If the tables won't turn, we flip them the fuck over.

So to counter this negative perception portrayed by these snakes infiltrating the DOGE and DOGINAL community, [@TheNodeRunners](https://twitter.com/TheNodeRunners) bring to you the "Anti Doginal Dogs," a 10,000-piece recursive collection, trolling these scammers immutably on the blockchain forever to be immortalized as the scumbags they are. *The ⁦@doginaldogsx⁩ aren't Doginal Anything!!!!*

**WE ARE THE DOGINAL COMMUNITY!!!**
