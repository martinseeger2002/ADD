# Anti Doginal Dogs (ADD)

This repository contains the data for the Anti Doginal Dogs (ADD) project. Each dog in the collection has a set of traits and values that need to be updated from [doggy.market](https://doggy.market/nfts/doginaldogs).

2. **Download the JSON File**:
   - Navigate to the `Anti_Doginal_Dogs.json` file in your forked repository.

3. **Find the Traits and Values**:

4. **Update the JSON File**:
   - Open the downloaded `Anti_Doginal_Dogs.json` file with a text editor.
   - Locate the entry for the dog you want to update.

     ```json
     [
         {
             "name": "Anti Dog #1",
             "traits": {
                 "Background": "Sky Blue",
                 "Fur Color": "Brown",
                 "Fur Pattern": "Spotted",
                 "Head": "Top Hat",
                 "Clothes": "Tuxedo",

                 "Accessory": "Bow Tie",
                 "txid": "123abc456def"
             }
         },
         ...
     ]
     ```

5. **Upload the Updated JSON File**:
   - Save the changes to the `Anti_Doginal_Dogs.json` file.
   - Upload the updated JSON file back to your forked repository. Replace the old file with the new one.

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "Pull requests" then "New pull request".
   - Ensure that the base repository is `martinseeger2002/ADD` and the base branch is `main`.
   - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the updates you made.
   - Submit the pull request.

7. **Avoid Duplicate Inscriptions**:
   - Before submitting your pull request, check the open pull requests in the [original repository](https://github.com/martinseeger2002/ADD/pulls) to ensure that no one else has already updated the same dog entry.
   - If someone else has already updated the dog, do not submit a duplicate update.
